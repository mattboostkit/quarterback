# Push to GitHub Instructions

Your code is ready to push to GitHub! Follow these steps:

## Option 1: Using GitHub Web Interface (Easiest)

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Create a new repository named "quarterback"
3. Make it public or private as you prefer
4. DO NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
5. After creating, you'll see instructions. Run these commands:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/quarterback.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Option 2: Using GitHub CLI

If you want to install GitHub CLI first:

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI on WSL
curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gh

# Login to GitHub
gh auth login

# Create repo and push
gh repo create quarterback --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

## Option 3: Using SSH

If you have SSH keys set up:

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/quarterback.git
git push -u origin main
```
